## Python Classes and Objects

This folder features the implementation of classes and objects in Python

Python classes and objects are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP is a programming paradigm that allows you to organize your code into reusable objects. Objects are self-contained bundles of data and functionality.


### Classes
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that objects of that class will have. 

### Objects
Objects are instances of class. To create an object from a class, you use the class_name() constructor. Once an object has been created, you can access its attributes and methods using the dot notation.


Python classes and objects are a powerful tool for organizing and reusing your code. By understanding how to use classes and objects, one can write more efficient and maintainable code.
