## Exceptions in Python

Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. They can be caused by a variety of factors, such as user input errors, file I/O errors, network errors etc.

Python provides a robust exception handling system that allows programmers to handle errors gracefully and prevent their programs from crashing. There are three main parts to exception handling in Python:

- try: This block contains the code that is most likely to generate an exception.

- except: This block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised in the try block.

- finally: This block contains code that will be executed regardless of whether or not an exception is raised.

Another part is:

- else: A way to specify code that will be executed only if no exception is raised in the try block.
